		<h3>Boat 01</h3>
		<p class="para1">
		A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity,
		or its ability to carry boats. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. However, some boats, 
		such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. 
		In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.
